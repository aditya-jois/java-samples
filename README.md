Object is similar to a real-world object and has state (field) and behavior (method).<br/>
Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation â€” a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.<br/>
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.<br/>
Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.<br/>

Methods form the object's interface with the outside world.<br/>
Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide. Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler. If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods defined by that interface must appear in its source code before the class will successfully compile.<br/>

A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.<br/>
Example: com.example.java.sample com.example.java.sample.HelloWorld.java<br/>
