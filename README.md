Object is similar to a real-world object and has state (field) and behavior (method).<br/>
Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation â€” a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.<br/>
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.<br/>
Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.<br/>
