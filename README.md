Object is similar to a real-world object and has state (field) and behavior (method).<br/>
Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods is known as data encapsulation â€” a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming.<br/>
A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.<br/>
Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.<br/>

Methods form the object's interface with the outside world.<br/>
Implementing an interface allows a class to become more formal about the behavior it promises to provide. Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world, and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler. If your class claims to implement an interface, all methods defined by that interface must appear in its source code before the class will successfully compile.<br/>

A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.<br/>
Example: com.example.java.sample com.example.java.sample.HelloWorld.java<hr/>
In the Java programming language, the terms "field" and "variable" are both used; this is a common source of confusion among new developers, since both often seem to refer to the same thing.<br/>
An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.<br/>

Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result.<br/>
Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values; expressions are the core components of statements; statements may be grouped into blocks.<br/>

Control flow statements, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.<br/>
