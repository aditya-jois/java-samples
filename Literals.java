public class Literals {

	// Literals

	// You may have noticed that the new keyword isn't used when initializing a
	// variable of a primitive type. Primitive types are special data types
	// built into the language; they are not objects created from a class. A
	// literal is the source code representation of a fixed value; literals are
	// represented directly in your code without requiring computation. As shown
	// below, it's possible to assign a literal to a variable of a primitive
	// type:

	boolean result = true;
	char capitalC = 'C';
	byte b = 100;
	short s = 10000;
	int i = 100000;

	// Integer Literals

	// An integer literal is of type long if it ends with the letter L or l;
	// otherwise it is of type int. It is recommended that you use the upper
	// case letter L because the lower case letter l is hard to distinguish from
	// the digit 1.

	// Values of the integral types byte, short, int, and long can be created
	// from int literals. Values of type long that exceed the range of int can
	// be created from long literals. Integer literals can be expressed by these
	// number systems:

	// Decimal: Base 10, whose digits consists of the numbers 0 through 9; this
	// is the number system you use every day
	// Hexadecimal: Base 16, whose digits consist of the numbers 0 through 9 and
	// the letters A through F
	// Binary: Base 2, whose digits consists of the numbers 0 and 1 (you can
	// create binary literals in Java SE 7 and later)
	// For general-purpose programming, the decimal system is likely to be the
	// only number system you'll ever use. However, if you need to use another
	// number system, the following example shows the correct syntax. The prefix
	// 0x indicates hexadecimal and 0b indicates binary:

	// The number 26, in decimal
	int decVal = 26;
	// The number 26, in hexadecimal
	int hexVal = 0x1a;
	// The number 26, in binary
	int binVal = 0b11010;

	// Floating-Point Literals

	// A floating-point literal is of type float if it ends with the letter F or
	// f; otherwise its type is double and it can optionally end with the letter
	// D or d.

	// The floating point types (float and double) can also be expressed using E
	// or e (for scientific notation), F or f (32-bit float literal) and D or d
	// (64-bit double literal; this is the default and by convention is
	// omitted).

	double d1 = 123.4;
	// same value as d1, but in scientific notation
	double d2 = 1.234e2;
	float f1 = 123.4f;

	// Character and String Literals

	// Literals of types char and String may contain any Unicode (UTF-16)
	// characters. If your editor and file system allow it, you can use such
	// characters directly in your code. If not, you can use a "Unicode escape"
	// such as '\u0108' (capital C with circumflex), or "S\u00ED Se\u00F1or" (Sí
	// Señor in Spanish). Always use 'single quotes' for char literals and
	// "double quotes" for String literals. Unicode escape sequences may be used
	// elsewhere in a program (such as in field names, for example), not just in
	// char or String literals.

	// The Java programming language also supports a few special escape
	// sequences for char and String literals: \b (backspace), \t (tab), \n
	// (line feed), \f (form feed), \r (carriage return), \" (double quote), \'
	// (single quote), and \\ (backslash).

	// There's also a special null literal that can be used as a value for any
	// reference type. null may be assigned to any variable, except variables of
	// primitive types. There's little you can do with a null value beyond
	// testing for its presence. Therefore, null is often used in programs as a
	// marker to indicate that some object is unavailable.

	// Finally, there's also a special kind of literal called a class literal,
	// formed by taking a type name and appending ".class"; for example,
	// String.class. This refers to the object (of type Class) that represents
	// the type itself.

	// Using Underscore Characters in Numeric Literals

	// In Java SE 7 and later, any number of underscore characters (_) can
	// appear anywhere between digits in a numerical literal. This feature
	// enables you, for example. to separate groups of digits in numeric
	// literals, which can improve the readability of your code.

	// For instance, if your code contains numbers with many digits, you can use
	// an underscore character to separate digits in groups of three, similar to
	// how you would use a punctuation mark like a comma, or a space, as a
	// separator.

	// The following example shows other ways you can use the underscore in
	// numeric literals:

	long creditCardNumber = 1234_5678_9012_3456L;
	long socialSecurityNumber = 999_99_9999L;
	float pi = 3.14_15F;
	long hexBytes = 0xFF_EC_DE_5E;
	long hexWords = 0xCAFE_BABE;
	long maxLong = 0x7fff_ffff_ffff_ffffL;
	byte nybbles = 0b0010_0101;
	long bytes = 0b11010010_01101001_10010100_10010010;

	// You can place underscores only between digits; you cannot place
	// underscores in the following places:

	// At the beginning or end of a number
	// Adjacent to a decimal point in a floating point literal
	// Prior to an F or L suffix
	// In positions where a string of digits is expected
	// The following examples demonstrate valid and invalid underscore
	// placements (which are highlighted) in numeric literals:

	// Invalid: cannot put underscores
	// adjacent to a decimal point
	float pi1 = 3_.1415F;
	// Invalid: cannot put underscores
	// adjacent to a decimal point
	float pi2 = 3._1415F;
	// Invalid: cannot put underscores
	// prior to an L suffix
	long socialSecurityNumber1 = 999_99_9999_L;

	// OK (decimal literal)
	int x1 = 5_2;
	// Invalid: cannot put underscores
	// At the end of a literal
	int x2 = 52_;
	// OK (decimal literal)
	int x3 = 5_______2;

	// Invalid: cannot put underscores
	// in the 0x radix prefix
	int x4 = 0_x52;
	// Invalid: cannot put underscores
	// at the beginning of a number
	int x5 = 0x_52;
	// OK (hexadecimal literal)
	int x6 = 0x5_2;
	// Invalid: cannot put underscores
	// at the end of a number
	int x7 = 0x52_;
