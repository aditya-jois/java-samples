		/*
		The following quick reference summarizes the operators supported by the Java programming language.
		
		Simple Assignment Operator
		=       Simple assignment operator
		
		Arithmetic Operators
		+       Additive operator (also used
		        for String concatenation)
		-       Subtraction operator
		*       Multiplication operator
		/       Division operator
		%       Remainder operator
		
		Unary Operators
		+       Unary plus operator; indicates
		        positive value (numbers are 
		        positive without this, however)
		-       Unary minus operator; negates
		        an expression
		++      Increment operator; increments
		        a value by 1
		--      Decrement operator; decrements
		        a value by 1
		!       Logical complement operator;
		        inverts the value of a boolean
		        
		The increment/decrement operators can be applied before (prefix) or after (postfix) the operand.
		The code result++; and ++result; will both end in result being incremented by one.
		The only difference is that the prefix version (++result) evaluates to the incremented value, whereas the postfix version (result++) evaluates to the original value.
		If you are just performing a simple increment/decrement, it doesn't really matter which version you choose.
		But if you use this operator in part of a larger expression, the one that you choose may make a significant difference.

		Equality and Relational Operators
		==      Equal to
		!=      Not equal to
		>       Greater than
		>=      Greater than or equal to
		<       Less than
		<=      Less than or equal to
		
		Conditional Operators
		&&      Conditional-AND
		||      Conditional-OR
		?:      Ternary (shorthand for 
		        if-then-else statement)

		Type Comparison Operator
		instanceof      Compares an object to 
		                a specified type

		Bitwise and Bit Shift Operators
		~       Unary bitwise complement
		<<      Signed left shift
		>>      Signed right shift
		>>>     Unsigned right shift
		&       Bitwise AND
		^       Bitwise exclusive OR
		|       Bitwise inclusive OR

		Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values; expressions are the core components of statements; statements may be grouped into blocks.
		An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.
		A statement forms a complete unit of execution.
		Expression statement | Declaration Statement | Control Flow Statement
		A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.
